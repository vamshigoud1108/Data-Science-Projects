## Project Overview
The main objective of the Customer Churn Prediction project is to analyze the demographics, service details, and financial metrics of telecom customers, including factors like gender, senior citizen status, tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and more, to predict whether a customer will leave the telecom service or not. Customer churn, the decision of customers to leave a telecom service, can significantly impact the company's revenue and growth. By accurately predicting customer churn, the telecom company can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.
## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from ![Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) and comprises 7,043 rows and 21 columns. The primary objective of the dataset is to predict whether a telecom customer will churn (leave the service) based on their demographics, service details, and financial information.

## Data Dictionary
| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CustomerId | Unique identification key for each customer |
| Gender | Gender of the customer (Male/Female)|
| SeniorCitizen | Binary flag indicating if the customer is a senior citizen (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
|Partner | Binary flag indicating if the customer has a partner (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
|Dependents | Binary flag indicating if the customer has dependents (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
|Tenure | Number of months the customer has been with the telecom service |
|PhoneService | Binary flag indicating if the customer has phone service (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
|MultipleLines | Binary flag indicating if the customer has multiple lines (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
|InternetService | Type of internet service subscribed to by the customer (DSL, Fiber optic, or None) |
|OnlineSecurity | Binary flag indicating if the customer has online security add-on (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
|TechSupport | Binary flag indicating if the customer has tech support add-on (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
|Contract | Type of contract (Month-to-month, One year, or Two year) |
|MonthlyCharges | Monthly charges paid by the customer (in dollars) |
|TotalCharges | Total charges paid by the customer over the tenure (in dollars) |
|Churn | Binary flag indicating if the customer churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No)|

## Impact
This project demonstrates how machine learning can accurately predict customer churn based on customer behavior and demographic data.Identifying key churn factorsâ€”such as tenure, monthly charges, and contract type provides valuable insights that help businesses:
- Improve customer retention strategies
- Enhance customer satisfaction
- Reduce churn risks and optimize revenue

## Conclusion
From the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), it was observed that key factors influencing customer churn include:

- **MonthlyCharges**: Higher monthly charges might drive churn due to cost dissatisfaction.
- **TotalCharges**: Long-term customers with higher total charges were less likely to churn.
- **Contract Type**: Customers with a month-to-month contract are more likely to churn compared to those with longer-term contracts.
- **Tenure**: Customers with a longer tenure are less likely to churn.
- **OnlineSecurity**: Customers without online security services are more likely to churn.
- **TechSupport**: Customers without technical support services have a higher likelihood of churning.

Coming to the evaluation of the machine learning models, I employed classification models Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Among these, the Random Forest model outperformed the others, achieving the highest accuracy(80%) and F1-score.Therefore, it is the most effective model for accurately predicting customer churn.
